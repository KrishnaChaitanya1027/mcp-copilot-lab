Recent Fixes & Enhancements
===========================

2025-10-15 â€” Incident Command Upgrade
------------------------------------
- Promoted the lab into an incident-ready cockpit with `tools/cases.py` for durable case timelines plus `tools/report_bundles.py` to zip everything into instant handoff packages.
- Wired continuous observability: `watch_dir`, `watch_dir_summary`, and the alert loop now orchestrate fingerprinted log polling, threshold triggers, and auto-saved forensics.
- Dropped a network x-ray trio (`http_diag`, `tls_diag`, `net_diag`) that streams redacted probes straight into `artifacts/` for copy/paste postmortems.
- Locked down credentials with the new RBAC layer (`tools/rbac.py`) and per-session secret vault (`tools/secrets.py`), all chained through consistent `{"ok": ...}` responses.
- Shipped a two-minute incident workout (`scripts/smoke.md`) showcasing how watchers, alerts, diagnostics, and bundles deliver a cinematic rehearsal from the CLI.

Server & Guardrails
-------------------
- Standardized all built-in tools to return structured dictionaries with an `ok` flag so clients can branch reliably on failures.
- Moved the sandbox root to `./artifacts`, keeping generated files quarantined from source while still enforcing extension and byte-size guardrails.
- Introduced shared helpers (`tools/tool_utils.py`) for unwrapping FastMCP results, allowing nested tools to compose without brittle JSON parsing.

Modular Tooling
---------------
- Added a persistent key/value store (`tools/kv_store.py`) with async helpers and optimistic corruption recovery.
- Layered a profile-aware configuration system (`tools/config.py`) that honors environment overrides and exposes management tools.
- Shipped workflow automation helpers:
  * `tools/plans.py` for opinionated multi-step recipes.
  * `tools/dynamic_plans.py` for on-the-fly templated sequences (with context propagation and optional KV snapshots).
- Delivered operational tooling:
  * `tools/progress.py` to read growing files incrementally and summarize new chunks.
  * `tools/watchers.py` to run plans when file fingerprints change.
  * `tools/alerts.py` to track log patterns and raise artifacts or downstream plans once thresholds hit.
  * `tools/artifacts.py` to persist text/JSON/binary outputs and surface previews in chat.
  * `tools/templates.py` to manage reusable report templates that pull from KV, config, and saved artifacts.

Quality of Life
---------------
- Seeded sample artifacts/logs plus a default KV database to demonstrate the new tooling.
- Documented quick-start prompts directly inside the modules to guide extending/customizing the system.
